            <p>As I lift my head up and open my mouth, my voice escalates with every tune that comes out. 
               The soothing words bounce off of my tongue and release the tension held within.
               Even if the sounds aren’t perfect or correct, every little bit helps me get through the day.
                When stressed, nothing helps me more than singing. My passion for singing comes from deep within my soul, mind and heart. 
                When I sing, I sing with all of me, putting everything I can into it. I have always had a great passion for singing, ever since I was young.
                Although I am shy and still get nervous and shaky in front of others, in my own time, singing

                <p>I sing a lot, but it’s always in my own time, when no one else is around except maybe my mother or father. Even my own brothers, I’m scared to sing in front of. 
                   I am an all around shy person, therefore, getting up in front of people to sing is just not my thing. I have been asked to sing and put on the spot before and I just cannot do it.
                   It bothers me that I am so shy with something that I enjoy spending my time doing. When I’m all alone, I block everything out and I’m not hesitant to express, with my voice, what I am feeling.
                   However, when other people are around my voice goes back into its shell, as it becomes conscious that there are people around, listening. Hopefully, one day I can build up enough courage and my hands will stop shaking every time I get in front of others, 
                  so I can show them how important singing is to me and what a joy it is and has been throughout my life to do i
